# Crypto-Chain

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google that provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. GCP offers laaS, PaaS, and Saas products.
## Real-Time Data Streaming
Real-time data streaming involves collecting and ingesting a sequence of data from various data sources and processing that data in real time to extract meaning and insight.
Examples of streaming data are log files generated by customers using your mobile or web applications, ecommerce purchases, in-game player activity, information from social networks, financial trading floors, or geospatial services, and telemetry from connected devices or instrumentation in data centers.

## Components of real-time streaming
• Source: 
  Examples are mobile devices, web applications (clickstream), application logs, loT sensors, smart devices and gaming applications.

• Stream Ingestion:
  Simple integration with different services that allows you to capture continuous data being produced from thousands of devices in a durable and secure 
  manner.

• Stream Storage:
  After streaming, the data is stored on any storage of choice based on requirements.

• Stream Processing

• Destination

## Business Introduction
Crypto chain Solutions is a cutting-edge financial trading firm specializing in real-time cryptocurrency analysis and automated trading strategies. The company is focused on delivering the most up-to-date market insights, provides trading professionals and institutional investors with tools for analyzing and executing crypto trades efficiently.
The company is dedicated to utilizing innovative technologies to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency markets.

## Problem Statement
The company currently relies on delayed data feeds, which hinder its ability to make timely, accurate decisions for trading cryptocurrency pairs like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB). In order to gain a competitive advantage, the company aims to ingest and process live market data from CoinAPlio and use that information for real-time analytics, machine learning models, and strategy adjustments.

## Key Challenges-
(The existing data architecture faces these challenges)
• Delayed Data:
  Uses traditional APIs

• Scalability: 
  The system struggles to scale

• Integration Challenges: 
  The system can't integrate with cloud-native solutions.

• Manual Data Processing: 
  Analysts manually process data in batches.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION -
The proposed solution is to implement a real-time data pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that ingests market data from Binance's WebSocket, processes the data using Apache Beam, and stores it in BigQuery for real-time analytics and reporting.

## Data Source: Binance WebSocket API
The primary data source for CryptoStream Solutions is the Binance WebSocket API, which provides real-time cryptocurrency market data. Binance offers WebSocket endpoints for live updates on trading pairs such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, and BNB/USDT.

## The API provides continuous updates on:
• Price Changes: Latest price percentage change, and price direction.
• Trade Volume: Amount of crypto traded over specific intervals.
• Market Depth: Order book updates showing buy/sell offers.



## Tech Stack 
Binance websocket API
Apache Beam
BigQuery
Python
Google Pub/Sub
Cloud Dataflow

## Highlevel Architecture
• Real-Time Data Ingestion:
  We will use Binance WebSocket API to fetch live market data for multiple cryptocurrency pairs

• Data Streaming with Google Pub/Sub: 
  Google Pub/Sub will act as the messaging service to handle the streaming within the GCP environment

• Data Processing with Apache Beam:
  We will use Apache Beam - a real-time processing framework (via Cloud Dataflow) to transform, clean, and prepare the data.

• Storage in BigQuery: 
  BigQuery will serve as the real-time data warehouse, allowing the company to query the latest price data and historical market information for
  analytics and reporting.
  
• Scalable and Cloud-Native:
  The entire architecture will seat on Google Cloud to ensure low maintenance overhead and adaptability for future requirements.

## Important Concepts
• Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
• Real-Time Data Streaming (WebSocket API, Pub/Sub Messaging)
• Apache Beam
• Windowing and Triggers
• BigQuery
• Scalability and Cloud-Native Infrastructure



## Use cases of real-time streaming
• Real-Time Data Movement: 
  Streaming data from hundreds of thousands of devices and performing ETL transformations on high volumes of continuous, high velocity data in 
  realtime allows users to analyze data as soon as it is produced, and then durably store the data in a data lake, data warehouse, or database for further analysis.
  
• Real-Time Analytics:
  Analyze data as soon as it is produced and enable real-time decisions across an organization to capitalize on opportunities, enhance customer 
  experiences, prevent networking failures, or update critical business metrics in real-time.
  
• Logs:
  Capture, process and analyze logs from your applications in real-time.

## Technologies for real-time streaming
• Websockets
• Apache Kafka
• Google Cloud Pub/Sub

## Apache Beam
Apache Beam is a flexible programming SDK for building data processing pipelines that can handle batch processing, stream processing, and parallel processing in one. Its unified model allows developers to define and execute abstract data workflows to be deployed on one of any number of different data processing engines, such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Google Cloud Dataflow, and Kafka.
